                <div class="divider-left"></div>
                <h3>1. Delivery</h3>
                <p class="indented"><b>1.1&nbsp;</b> Before delivering your goods, one of the seller's representatives will confirm the delivery address and other details, based on the terms you agreed with the seller when you placed your order.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>1.2&nbsp;</b> The seller will attempt to deliver your goods within seven days of you placing your order. If you wish to make other arrangements, you will have to make arrangements to take delivery in line with the agreed changes.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>1.3&nbsp;</b> The Seller will always try to meet stated delivery dates. But if the delivery date is not critical, the seller will not be liable for any losses, costs, damages or expenses you, or any third-party incurred, either directly or indirectly, because of the estimated delivery date not being achieved.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>1.4&nbsp;</b> When you place your order, some products may be out of stock. If the seller can't deliver the products within seven days (see Clause 3.2) one of the sellers representatives will contact you to explain the position and you will have the option to cancel your order, get a total refund or choose to have your order delivered at a later date.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>1.5&nbsp;</b> Once the goods have been delivered, title and risk in the goods will pass to you.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>1.6&nbsp;</b> If you place your order before 11am, RKW will aim to deliver you goods the following day, if next day (Parcelforce) service has been selected. This does not apply where weekends are involved. Delivery will cost £5.95. Alternatively your goods will be transported by Yodel on 2-3 working days service at £4.95. When you are ordering, always make sure you fill in your contact details on the checkout screen.</p>
                <p class="indented-last"><b>1.7&nbsp;</b> If you want goods delivered to the Highlands, Islands or the Republic of Ireland, you should check with a seller representative from before you order, because shipping charges depend on size, weight and destination. Unless there are clear indications to the contrary, the seller will ship your goods within two days of you placing your order. The seller will give you notice of any delays or cancellations.</p>
                <h3>2. Warranty</h3>
                <p class="indented-last"><b>2.1&nbsp;</b> Depending on the product, the seller offers a standard one-year warranty. You will find the length of the warranty confirmed in the instruction manual for the product. If you ask for a refund, the seller will use the order number you give us, to check the date you bought the product. If you have had the product longer than the agreed warranty period, we will not be able to give you a refund. Read more on how to extend your warranty.</p>
                <h3>3. Cancellation / Returns and Refunds</h3>
                <p class="indented"><b>3.1&nbsp;</b> The seller delivers many thousands of products and only a small fraction prove faulty. Of course, the seller understands how difficult this might be for you. That’s why we have no-quibble returns, refund or replacement policy to make sure our customers always feel they are receiving the highest levels of service.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>3.2&nbsp;</b> You should check the goods as soon as they arrive, and let the seller know if there is any damage or if anything does not meet the terms of your contract. You should do this by letter, email or fax within seven days of delivery, excluding Saturday, Sunday or Bank Holidays.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>3.3&nbsp;</b> If the defective goods are large, then the seller will arrange for collection. For smaller items, you should return them to the seller who will, after agreeing that the goods are defective, will deliver a replacement or a total refund. This will include delivery costs, if appropriate, and any return mailing costs.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>3.4&nbsp;</b> When you return goods, you must make sure the order number is clearly visible on the packaging. You will find the number on the order confirmation email which is sent to you automatically once you have paid for the product. If you haven't got the order number, the seller will provide you with one.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>3.5&nbsp;</b> If the seller decides that the damaged goods are due to your actions, you will be liable for the costs of making good the damage.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>3.6&nbsp;</b> If you have bought the goods on the internet, by mail order or by phone/fax, you have the right, in addition to any other rights, to return the products and get a total refund. However, you must let the seller know by letter, fax or email with seven working days of the date of your purchase. You must pay for the return the goods. The seller advises using recorded or special delivery. You should take out appropriate insurance for the total cost of the goods, including delivery charges, if applicable - except for return postal costs incurred if the product is faulty and you return the products within 30 days of cancellation.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>3.7&nbsp;</b> Returns address: Customer Support. Warmlite Heating. Sutton House, Berry Hill Road, Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire ST4 2NL. Email address: sales@warmliteheating.co.uk Tel: 0333 220 6056.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>3.8&nbsp;</b> When you return products, their condition should be similar to that when delivered the seller. You should return the product complete will all packaging, if originally supplied. All the products you return should be complete, because incomplete returns will not qualify for a refund, and will be classified as unauthorised.</p>
                <p class="indented"><b>3.9&nbsp;</b> You must return the goods with your name, address, telephone number and email address. The seller may get in touch with you before the date the refund is due, to ask for the product’s serial number and the fault details to forward on to the manufacturer. Any unauthorised goods returned to us will be managed with on receipt.</p>
                <p>You should allow three days for the seller to complete a return. Refunds will be applied to the card you used to pay for the product.</p>
